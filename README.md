# red_runner MADE USING UNITY3D 2019.4.17F1
This project is made using a collection of the most know assets in the asset store, plateformer 2D game with main menu and couple of levels i designed myself all the game mechanics are programmed here and i'm still working on it, you are welcome to download and try this

# Resources

To keep things clear, ALL THE ASSETS, AUDIO, SFX, VFX, UI, 2D or anything you can see/hear is taken from "Unity3D ASSETS STORE", "OPEN GAME ART", or other websites.
I only did the game logic and the level design.

# About the project ?

  This project is a Unity 2D game, no specific plateforms but another repo will be available for Mobile plateform version, the game is very simple, take your small red character 
  and try to finish all the level, theres only 2 levels for now, the first is too easy, 2nd is a bit harder, i like making super hard levels and i'm now prototyping the next 3rd one
  which i wanna make it impossible to beat.
  
  # Mobile version repo ?
      Well yes, a mobile version repository will be available soon with google sign in, mobile controle, a bit more optimized for mobiles, 
      URP going tp be used to to make some good looking levels.

# Game over menu 
    
   and its the same one appearing when you complete the level but with GG msg and go to next level or back to main menu

  the collectable items are now saved just using player prefs, more is coming when implementing backend, save files and database will be added soon!

# The player control is very basic,

What i liked about is, it makes the game harder as the player should read when and how to jump for example so he won't touch obstacles and die!

# Legendary Level 2 and awesome musics with VFX

Well, its a bit hard i said, adding the character control, you will have to die few time before finishing it.

# Serious talk :

Assets used : 

* Bayat games free platform game assets.
* EffectsTexturesAndPrefabs
* JMO Assets
and some others coming from opengameart.org .

# Scripting

* While most of the time is spent thinking about how will the level 2 looks like, the script of this game is pretty simple and easy, player and projectile movements, game loop (life, death replay or go back to main menu), data for now are just the gems or coins which are saved only using playerprefs.
* Managers to manage each scene, settings, players stats etc.
* UI scripts for the Countdown timer, buttons interractivity, scores, gold, pause menu.


# Whats coming in the future

  This is one of the tons of project i'm going to push to my github, i have more complicated projects like simulations and more that i want to push, since university is taking all of my life this will take time, but for the time being i'm going to focus on this project, before doing anything i'm going to create a mobile platforms repo with the same project in, mobile control, google sign in, backend (save files, database something like that) to save player's progress.
  I'm open for any suggestions for levels prototype, or any idea about making this solo game competetive (even with timer and dashboard).
